            <p class="large_header">Hi!</p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I’m Caleb, a newly-graduated software developer from Oregon State.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I’ve been programming text-based languages for nearly a decade.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                My earliest exposure to text-based programming was in FIRST Robotics Competition.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                My main language at the time was Java, but also gained some experience in Python, C, and C++ at the time.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I’m still involved with FRC to this day as a lead software mentor for team #957!
            </p>


            <p class="large_header">What else have I done?</p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I graduated from Oregon State in 2024 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">                
                Most of my time in college was spent improving my software development ability and gaining an interest in the entire process as a whole, from requirements to design to implementation to documentation.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I also started leveraging the more powerful features of Git, including Actions, Pages, and reference documentation deployment.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                My Capstone project, which was contributing to the open-source Audiolux Audio Visualizer codebase, can be found here.
            </p>

            <p class="large_header">What’s next?</p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I’m currently looking for remote work.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">                
                I pick up new skills quickly and am actively looking to broaden my horizons.
            </p>
            <p class="blurb">
                I have a (probably) complete list of all my skills on this site’s “skills” page.
